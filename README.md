# Starcraft Crew

This project was specially designed for the git course made by Curiosity.

The project is forked by a custom account created for the course, in order to make it easier to review the contribution of the participants in each sesion.

## Getting Started

The goal is to create your own presentation card with which you are going to be identified as part of the crew.  Try your best, be specific and have fun while learning!

### Prerequisites

The project do not use any backend or frontend framework, this in order to make it simpler to understand and to avoid the need to install third party tools and frameworks. After all, this is a git course.  

To complete this workshop you must:

1. Have git installed in your machine
2. Have studied the whole course and approved all the exams
3. Have an enthusiastic attitude! Remember, you are a valuable part of the crowd.

### Installing

To clone the project into your local machine use the command:

```
git clone <repo>
```
